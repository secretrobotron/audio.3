All mods are "4 channel M.K" (Protracker) format unless otherwise specified. Created in MilkyTracker
Notes will generally continue to ring out because the volume effect is not used. (Strict test of 1 effect at a time!)
This is the correct behavior.


basic.mod

	Simple playback. C major scale with 1 sine sample.

	CORRECT:	Plays C scale for one octave
	WRONG:		Anything else

break.mod

	Test of Dxx pattern break.
	Frame 1 C major (forward) on row 0x0A
	Frame 2 C major (backward)

	CORRECT:	Immediately plays C scale BACKWARD
	WRONG:		Plays C forward first

break_far.mod

	Dxx test. Ensures that player processes offset as DECIMAL not hex.
	Frame 1 C major (forward) on row 2 after B32 jump
	Frame 2 C major (backward) on row 0x20

	CORRECT:	Immediately plays C scale BACKWARD
	WRONG:		Plays C forward first

	Tests Bxx "jump to order" command (specific place in pattern table)

	CORRECT:	Immediately plays C scale BACKWARD.
	WRONG:		Plays C forward first

fineporta.mod

	Tests E1x, fine pitch slide up.
	Alternates between normal slide (1xx) and fine slide. Both should sound identical

	CORRECT:	Slides sound identical, and a fixed tone rings out after 6 repeats
	WRONG:		Slides sound different
				Pitch continues to slide up after 6 repeats (applying to incorrect rows)
				One or the other sounds flat (slide not working)
